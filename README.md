# Goffee
Coffee stands for Go for Coffee and it is a simple demo project for a quick way of ordering your coffee.

# The idea
Let' s assume that a user orders the same coffee everyday. Goffee comes and automates this procude by allowing a profile page for each user. He can change and update his settings and use the DIY button which will be placed in his desk. By clicking the button, the user creates an HTTP request to the Goffee server and then the order with his personal data is send back to the coffee shop. Each coffee shop is equicped with a shop page, which is different from the user page and it is able to view and interact with its daily orders.

#Screenshots
Goffee landing page is a simple login page with two login ways. The first one is for coffee shops and the second on is for any user who want to save his personal coffee preferences.

User coffee preferences page is simple and displays only the necessary details about the coffee. I wanted to keep it simple and functional since it is quite easy to expand and display more details.

Each coffee shop has its own list of orders.

In each order row more defails can be found after a click on the row
